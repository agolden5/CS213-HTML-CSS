<h1>Studying Advice</h1>
<p>Much of the advice people give about studying is wrong. Here are some study tips that are based on actual research.</p>
<h3>Alternate study environment</h3>
<p>Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room.</p>
<p>Varying the place you study helps you remember more</p>
<h3>Mix content</h3>
<p>Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some of this again, some of the other.</p>
<p>Switching content helps you remember more.</p>
<h3>Space study sessions</h3>
<p>Three one-hour sessions are more efficient than one three-hour session.</p>
<h3>Self-testing</h3>
<p>Test yourself or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.</p>

<p>I have run this page through W3C HTML and CSS validators and meets all the W3C standards for HTML and CSS</p>
